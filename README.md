# Mouse Cursor Control Using Eye Movements

## Overview
Managing a computer mouse can be challenging for individuals with physical impairments. This project addresses this issue by developing a system that allows users to control the mouse cursor using ocular movements, specifically leveraging the capabilities of eye gaze and facial expressions. This alternative input method aims to enhance accessibility and improve the quality of life for disabled individuals worldwide.

## Key Features
- **Ocular Control:** Control mouse cursor movements using eye movements and facial expressions.
- **Webcam Integration:** Utilizes a webcam to track head and eye movements without requiring additional hardware.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Blinking or squinting activates mouse clicks, while head movements control cursor direction (up, down, sideways).

## Benefits
- **Accessibility:** Enables independent computer use for individuals with physical disabilities.
- **Natural Interaction:** Mimics natural human actions to provide intuitive control.
- **Cost-Effective:** Utilizes existing technology (webcam) to reduce setup costs.

## Implementation Details
- **Technology:** Implemented in Python using computer vision techniques for iris tracking and cursor control.
- **User Interface:** Designed to replicate natural human routines, ensuring ease of use and familiarity.
- **Enhanced Dependability:** Aims to improve accuracy and reliability in eye tracking for seamless user-computer interaction.
